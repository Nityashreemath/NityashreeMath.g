                                I am Nityashree G Math</h1><br><br>
            <h2>Welcome to my student portfolio </h2><br><br>
            <h3>As an Engineering student, I have always had an interest in the intersection of technology and creativity. While working on a group project, I discovered UI/UX designing, and it immediately resonated with me. I am passionate about creating designs that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional, and I believe that user-centered design is the key to achieving this goal.</h3><br>
            <h3>As a good listener, I try to understand the needs and problems of the end-users and empathize with their issues. I then use this understanding to brainstorm different ideas and come up with solutions that can improve their overall user experience. I am also proficient in various design tools like  Adobe XD, and Figma and have experience in coding languages such as HTML and CSS.</h3><br>
        <h3>Ultimately, my goal is to pursue a career in UI/UX design and make a positive impact on people's lives through design. I am excited to continue exploring this field and expanding my knowledge and skills through internships, professional development opportunities, and other experiences. Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio.</h3>
