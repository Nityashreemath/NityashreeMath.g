      <h1> WEBSITE REDESIGN </h1><br>
      <hr><br>
      <h1>Overview :</h1><br><br>
      <p>Hamley’s is the world's oldest toy retailer . While going through its website I felt there was a room for improvement in the UI so I took up the challenge and redesigned it to make it look more organized and user friendly </p>
      <br><br><br>

      <h1>Approach</h1><br><br>
      <img src="hamleyprocess.png" alt="" width="50%"><br><br><br><br>

      <h1>Research and Understanding</h1><br>
      <p>The website followed a theme but there is inconsistency overall. The website needed to be de cluttered for the user to navigate through the website easily.</p>
      <br><br><p><b>Competitive analysis:</b></p>
      <br><p> <b>&nbsp &nbsp 1.Firstcry.com</b></p>
      <h3>  i.   The target audience of the website is similar to Hamley’s. <br>
           ii.   The UI for the website is better but it is still distracting all the areas demand for equal amount of attention. <br>
           iii. There are too many items on the navigation bar. </h3>
        <p> <b>&nbsp &nbsp 2. Funcorp.com</b></p>
        <h3>  i. The target audience of the website is similar to Hamley’s.  <br>
          ii. The UI is cluttered as all the different brands having different colors are displayed on the center of the front page which makes it look cluttered. <br>
           iii. The UX of the website is similar to Hamley’s website.  </h3>
        
        <h1>User Flow:</h1><br><br>
        <p>After Conducting user interviews and analyzing them i found that there is no major issues with the UX of the website except there was no rating section available  </p>
        <br><p>Almost all the users found the UI very cluttered and uneasy to browse through </p>
       <br><br> <img src="ushm.png" alt="" width="80%" class="hi"><br><br><br>
        <h2>Design principles not followed:</h2><br>
        <p>i. Hierarchy <br>
           ii.  Consistency <br>
            iii. Accessibility <br>
        </p><br>
        <h2>Outcome of research:</h2><br>
        <p>i. Overwhelming home page <br>
            ii. Many tabs on Navigation bar <br>
            iii. Inconsistent fonts <br>
            iv. Design principles not followed
        </p><br><br>
        <h1>Goal</h1><br><br>
        <p>
           i. To declutter the home page <br>
           ii. To organize the navigation bar <br>
           iii. Make the buttons uniform across pages <br><br><br>
        </p>
        <h1>Ideation</h1><br>
        <p>My major Goal was to make the text legible but to keep the essence of the website same so i stuck with the original color theme of the website. 
            Before designing i created a mood board for the website.</p>
        <br><br><h2>Moodboard</h2><br><br>
